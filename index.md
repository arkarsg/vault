> *A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Instead of polished articles displayed in reverse chronological order like a blog, a digital garden is more like a free form, work-in-progress wiki.*
