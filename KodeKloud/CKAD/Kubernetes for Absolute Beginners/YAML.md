`YAML` is a data serialization format, similar to `JSON`

## Key-value pairs
In `YAML`, data is represented in `key-value` pairs

```yaml
Fruit: Apple
Vegetable: Carrot
```

## Array
An array is represented with a key followed by a list denoted by `-`
```yaml
Fruits:
	- Orange
	- Apple
	- Banana
Vegetable:
	- Carrot
	- Broccoli
```

## Dictionary
A set of properties grouped together under an item
```yaml
Banana:
	Calories: 105
	Fat: 0.5
Carrot:
	Calories: 100
	Fat: 0.1
```

>[!caution]
>The *group* that item belongs to are defined by the number of spaces.
