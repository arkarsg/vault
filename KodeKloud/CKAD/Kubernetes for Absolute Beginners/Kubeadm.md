Set up Kubernetes cluster with the best practices

1. Need multiple VMs visible. Can be physical or virtual machines
2. Designate one of the VMs as a master
3. Install `conatinerd` â€” container run time on all the nodes
4. Install `kubeadm` on all the nodes
5. Initialise the master server

## Pod network
Once the pod network is set up, the worker nodes can join the master nodes
